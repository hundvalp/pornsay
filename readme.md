## The Highly Inappropriate and Bizarre Companion to `cowsay`
`pornsay` is the result of a jolly good time spent with programmer friends. As abysmal as it is, it's served as a good foray into bash scripting and parsing via regex. It basically scours the web for porn video titles and feeds them into a My Little Pony version of `cowsay` and a speech synthesizer.

`ponysay` and `festival`/`espeak` dependencies not included.

### Roadmap
- Usage information
- rc file
  - Ability to specify what commands to run on the titles
- More reliable parsing
